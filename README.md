# Pretext Kurdish Sorani

## Introduction

This repository is a testament to the ongoing effort of adapting PreTeXt, a markup language typically used for mathematical and scientific textbooks, for Kurdish Sorani, a Right-to-Left (RTL) language. The PreTeXt community is now working to extend its support to RTL languages, starting with Kurdish Sorani. The examples provided in this repository aim to serve as a constructive feedback mechanism, allowing PreTeXt developers to monitor and enhance their progress.


## Content of this Repository

This repository contains samples of Kurdish Sorani math writing that utilize PreTeXt.
