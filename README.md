# Pretext Kurdish Sorani

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the development and implementation of PreTeXt for Kurdish Sorani, a Right-to-Left (RTL) language. PreTeXt is a markup language for writing mathematical and scientific textbooks, and while it was initially designed for Left-to-Right (LTR) languages, PreTeXt community are working on modifying it to accommodate RTL languages for Kurdish which will be useful for other RTL language too. My main goal here is provide sample that serve as a feedback so PreTeXt developers see progress.  

## Content of this Repository

This repository contains samples of Kurdish Sorani math writing that utilize PreTeXt.
