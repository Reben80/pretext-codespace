# Pretext Kurdish Sorani

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the development and implementation of PreTeXt for Kurdish Sorani, a Right-to-Left (RTL) language. PreTeXt is a markup language for writing mathematical and scientific textbooks, and while it was initially designed for Left-to-Right (LTR) languages, we are working on modifying it to accommodate RTL languages. Our aim is to make it easier for authors to create math textbooks in Kurdish Sorani.

## Content of this Repository

This repository contains samples of Kurdish Sorani math textbooks that utilize PreTeXt. These samples serve as examples of what can be accomplished with this tool and provide a basis for further development.
